/**
 * A Kafka {@link Serializer} that delegates to the serializer the sink would otherwise use (Glue Avro,
 * Confluent Avro, or ByteArray), then encrypts the bytes it produced. Because it delegates, it works
 * for every serialization path.
 *
 * <p>Sitting on the outside of the delegate is what makes encryption the <em>final</em> step: the
 * value on the wire is {@code encrypt(serialize(record))}. The mirror of
 * {@link DecryptingDeserializer}, which decrypts before delegating, down to how a null or empty
 * serialized value is handled — both are written through unencrypted, for two different reasons.
 *
 * <p>A null value means "delete this key" to a compacted topic, and only while it stays null on the
 * wire; there is no envelope that could carry it. An empty value <em>could</em> be encrypted — the
 * cipher accepts an empty plaintext and returns the authentication tag — but is not, so that the
 * raw sink's round trip stays symmetric with the source, which passes an empty value to its
 * delegate undecrypted. Neither case loses protection: an empty plaintext carries no information,
 * and the envelope would advertise its length regardless.
 *
 * <p>The delegate is configured by the caller ({@code ProducerConfig}) before being wrapped, so this
 * wrapper does not override {@link #configure}; Kafka's inherited no-op is sufficient.
