/**
 * Reuses one data encryption key for the lifetime of the process: the DEK is generated on first use
 * and rotation happens by process restart, so a redeploy rotates it. Consumers need no coordination,
 * since every message carries its own wrapped DEK.
 *
 * <p>A decorator over any {@link DekGenerator}, so key reuse is backend-agnostic. Generation is
 * serialized so a burst of concurrent first messages produces one key, not one per thread. There is
 * no retry here: a failed generation fails that message, which Numaflow redelivers.
 *
 * <p>The plaintext is erased (zero-filled) on {@link #close()}, which runs only after the sinker has
 * terminated — so no encryption can still be using the key. It must never be logged.
