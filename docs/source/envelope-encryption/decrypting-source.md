# Read envelope-encrypted payloads

### Introduction

Some producers wrap the Kafka message value in an **encryption envelope** before sending it: a data
encryption key (DEK) encrypts the payload with AES-256-GCM, and the DEK itself is wrapped by a
key-management service. This source can transparently **decrypt the value before deserialization**, so
a Numaflow MonoVertex or Pipeline can consume encrypted topics.

Decryption is **independent of serialization** — it works with any `schemaType`. The decrypted bytes
are handed to the normal deserializer for that `schemaType`, so the downstream output is identical to
the equivalent non-encrypted topic.

A **null** or **empty** value is handed to the deserializer without decrypting, mirroring the
[encrypting sink](../../sink/envelope-encryption/encrypting-sink.md), which writes both through
unencrypted — the round trip is symmetric.

The only key-management backend supported today is **AWS KMS**.

It is **opt-in**: decryption runs only when the AWS KMS key ARN is configured. With the key unset, the
source behaves exactly as before and makes no calls to the key-management service.

### Envelope format

The Kafka message value is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "enc_ver": 1,
  "alg": "AES-256-GCM",
  "ciphertext_dek": "<base64 KMS-wrapped DEK>",
  "nonce": "<base64 12-byte nonce>",
  "ciphertext": "<base64 AES-256-GCM output, 16-byte tag appended>"
}
```

After decryption, `ciphertext` yields the plaintext the configured `schemaType` expects — for
`schemaType: raw`, the record bytes, forwarded as they are.

### Prerequisites

1. A topic whose values are produced in the envelope format above, with the DEK wrapped by an AWS KMS
   key.

2. AWS credentials available to the pod with permission to decrypt under that key:

   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
     "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/<key-id>"
   }
   ```

### Configuration

Add the following to `consumer.properties` (managed by kafka-java — consumed internally, not passed to
the Kafka client):

| Property | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payload.envelope.encryption.provider.aws-kms.key.arn` | Yes, to enable decryption | — | Full KMS key ARN. Its presence enables decryption; it is enforced as the `KeyId` on `Decrypt` (KMS rejects ciphertext wrapped under any other key). |
| `payload.envelope.encryption.dek.cache.ttl.ms` | No | `3600000` (1 h) | How long a recovered plaintext DEK is cached in memory to avoid a `Decrypt` call per message. Provider-agnostic (applies regardless of key backend). |

The existing `assumeRoleArn` property, if set, is reused for KMS, so that role must carry
`kms:Decrypt` (see IAM above). One role covers everything this source talks to, so if your
`schemaType` also uses a schema registry, the same role needs those permissions as well. See
[Assuming an IAM role](../avro-glue/avro-glue-source.md#assuming-an-iam-role) for the STS setup.

Everything else — `schemaType`, Kafka connection, and credentials — is configured exactly as for a
non-encrypted source.

### Example

This example reads a topic whose values are envelope-encrypted and writes to the built-in log sink.
It uses `schemaType: raw` — bytes in, bytes out — so that decryption is the only thing it
demonstrates.

To decrypt Avro instead, add the registry configuration from the [Avro](../avro/avro-source.md) or
[Glue Avro](../avro-glue/avro-glue-source.md) source docs. Nothing about the decryption setup changes.

1. Create the AWS credentials secret (see
   [credentials management](../../credentials-management/protecting-credentials.md)) — its identity
   needs `kms:Decrypt` on the key.

2. Deploy the ConfigMap and pipeline:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/encrypted-consumer-config.yaml
   kubectl apply -f manifests/encrypted-consumer-pipeline.yaml
   ```

3. Once running, the log sink shows the decrypted values — identical to what the
   [encrypting sink](../../sink/envelope-encryption/encrypting-sink.md) produced.

### Failure behavior

The source **fails fast** (logs a clear error and exits, so the pod restarts) on any unrecoverable
condition: a malformed key ARN at startup; or, per message, a value that is not a valid envelope, an
unsupported `alg`, a KMS `Decrypt` failure (including ciphertext wrapped under a different key), or an
authentication-tag failure (tampering / wrong key). A poison or tampered message will therefore
crash-loop the vertex until its offset is advanced or the message is removed. Plaintext keys and
decrypted payloads are never logged.
